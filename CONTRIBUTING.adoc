=== Set Up Dev Environment

Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to properly set up the dev environment for AIOB.

==== Python Environment

Python3.10 is the main python version AIOB used, while Python3.9 is also supposed to be supported. Ideally, you should install both versions.

I recommend using `pyenv` to manage your python verions.

NOTE: It is possible to develop AIOB with only Python3.9/3.10, however you will not be able to run `tox` to test in both supported Python versions.
